# Weather Finder App

**Weather Finder** is an app that allows users to search for weather information for cities around the world. The application uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and display information such as current temperature, maximum and minimum temperatures, and error messages for invalid cities or missing fields.

## Technologies Used

- **React** - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript** - A typed superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- **Vite** - A fast build tool for modern web projects.
- **Zod** - Used for data validation, ensuring that the response from the API is in the correct format.
- **Axios** - To make HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **CSS Modules** - To scope styles to individual components in the app.

## Features

- Search weather by city and country.
- Displays current temperature, maximum and minimum temperatures.
- If the city is not found or fields are incomplete, an error message is shown.
- Simple, modern user interface.
